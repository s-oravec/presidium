    <article><p>At its core, Presidium is a static website generator built on <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> that includes <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> components for features such as navigation and search. This model enables users to publish their content quickly and painlessly. Being static simplifies publication - you don’t need to provision a server and can host your documentation in a matter of seconds on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> or <a href="https://pages.bitbucket.io/">Bitbucket</a>.</p>

<p>Presidium is more than a framework. It’s a framework built around a process. And, yes it’s opinionated, but it’s informed too - who wants to spend time documenting code? <em>Software documentation that doesn’t suck</em> is not just a tagline.</p>

    </div>

    

    <article><p>Presidium is more than a framework for producing documentation. It asks you to think about, structure, author, and publish content based on sensible best practices so you can write effective documentation, rather than producing documentation for documentation’s sake.</p>

<h1 id="supporting-learning-objectives--efficiency">Supporting Learning Objectives &amp; Efficiency</h1>

<p>Presidium recommends creating small ‘micro’ articles that convey enough information to fulfill a learning objective. Small articles are advantageous because they:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Usually only require a single author</li>
  <li>Force the author to focus on effectively describe a single concept</li>
  <li>Enable authors to quickly add documentation while also working on a product or service.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using this method, creating high quality content is part of the engineering process, not a deferred or protracted task.</p>

<h1 id="categorization">Categorization</h1>

<p>Often, either only a few people hold all the critical business and technical knowledge or information is spread across documents without organization or cohesion.
 Presidium suggests a way to categorize information that helps the writer compartmentalize and categorize knowledge, leading to more cohesive and logical documentation.</p>

<h2 id="overview--key-concepts">Overview &amp; Key Concepts</h2>

<p>Almost any knowledge base requires an overview to orient the reader in the correct domain. The Overview section should support and lead to a discussion of key concepts that <strong>prime</strong> the reader to use the rest of the content. These two sections are naturally presented first, and one should follow the another.</p>

<h2 id="prerequisites--getting-started">Prerequisites &amp; Getting Started</h2>

<p>For software projects, APIs, and similar documentation, most readers will require some initial preparation. This may include installing libraries or binaries and reading information before proceeding.</p>

<p>The Prerequisites section should support the information in Getting Started. The Getting Started section should be a quick deep-dive than enables a user to get from <em>nowhere</em> to <em>running</em> in minutes.</p>

<h2 id="best-practices">Best Practices</h2>

<p>The Best Practices section should contain the ideal path to follow to get the most out of your product or service and reduce the potential of encountering problems. They can be a combination of anecdotal knowledge, RFCs, white papers etc.</p>

<h2 id="reference">Reference</h2>

<p>References should enhance or support the information in other sections (for example, imported API documentation, deep-dives beyond the needs of most readers, etc.).</p>

<h2 id="recipes">Recipes</h2>

<p>Recipes are clear sets of steps that explain how to do something useful or unusual with your product or service.</p>

<h2 id="glossary">Glossary</h2>

<p>Glossary entries are bite-sized pieces of information that explain a concept, resolve jargon, or list synonyms for a particular term. Because all content in the Glossary can be used for automatic tooltip generation, a good rule of thumb is to make sure a glossary entry can be condensed into a tooltip without being verbose or introducing confusion.</p>

<h2 id="more">More</h2>

<p>Tools, Uses Cases, Updates, and Support are other sections you can use. You can also define your own sections in Presidium.</p>

    <article><p>The following workflow is recommended for authoring content using Presidium.</p>

<h1 id="identify-the-author">Identify the Author</h1>

<p>Whether you’re creating a single article or an entire section, make sure to include the author tag in the front matter.</p>

<h1 id="work-locally">Work Locally</h1>

<p>Presidium encourages you to write and review documentation on your local machine, rather than making changes directly on Github. The advantages to this workflow are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Changes are immediately viewable</li>
  <li>You can leverage Presidium’s validation tools</li>
  <li>Git commit history will have less noise</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="protect-master">Protect Master</h1>

<p>If you own the documentation project, make sure you prevent others from making commits or pushing to the Master branch. You will be publishing from the Master branch, so you want to maintain its integrity.</p>

<h1 id="work-on-a-branch">Work On a Branch</h1>

<p>If you’re adding new content, start out on a branch based off of Develop.</p>

<h1 id="review">Review</h1>

<p>Changes should be submitted as Pull Requests. Review all changes and merge into your Develop branch, then tag the release as a release for verification.</p>

<h1 id="tag-release--publish">Tag, Release &amp; Publish</h1>

<p>After you’ve finalized the new content, merge it into Master, tag it as a release, then publish to Github pages.</p>

    <article><p>Markdown is an ubiquitous, lighweight markup language known to almost any engineer. If you don’t know Markdown, it’s easy to learn. Presidium uses a version of Markdown known as <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#GitHub-flavored-markdown">Github Flavoured Markdown</a> and leverages this ‘common tongue’ to enable multiple contributors to create documentation quickly without wasting time doing <strong>point &amp; click</strong> styling or having to alter HTML and CSS.</p>

<h2 id="style-guides">Style Guides</h2>

<p>For any documentation project, a Markdown style guide ensures that contributors write documentation that is consistent with your intended tone and layout.</p>

<h2 id="flexibility">Flexibility</h2>

<p>If you need more flexibility than Markdown offers, you can also use HTML separately or mixed with Markdown content in articles.</p>

    <article><h1 id="structure">Structure</h1>

<p>For simplicity and transparency, the menu structure and associated directory structure are the same.</p>

<h1 id="behavior">Behavior</h1>

<p>A significant feature of the menu is its tree structure: each <strong>section or subsection is a node</strong> and content traverses from each node through its children. In Presidium, the node ‘name’ or title becomes the main header of the page. Everything outside of that sub-tree is not presented on the page. In this example, the user has clicked Content Structure. Everything under that section is displayed:</p>

<p><img src="/media/images/content_structure.png" alt="Content Structure" /></p>

<p>Note the URL: <code class="highlighter-rouge">/recipes/content-structure/</code>. When you click on a section or subsection title, the url is included in the path. If you click on an article in a subsection (for example, ‘Article Concatenation’), the URL changes to <code class="highlighter-rouge">/recipes/content-structure/#article-concatenation</code>.</p>
