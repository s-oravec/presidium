    <article><p>Before starting to write content it is best to spend some time anticipating what tasks you need to perform and making sure you have the time and resources to achieve your goals.</p>

<p>We have found that the following outline plan is useful for small and large projects alike.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>Design  site structure</li>
    <li>Inventory existing content</li>
    <li>Plan the decomposition of existing content into articles</li>
    <li>Map the planned articles to your structure</li>
    <li>Identify required new articles</li>
    <li>Decompose existing content into articles</li>
    <li>Write new articles</li>
    <li>Proof read and edit</li>
    <li>Publish</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="discussion">Discussion</h1>

<p>Your most important task in planning your activities is to identify the scope of your documentation efforts. This is best started by understanding the needs of your audience. Presidium is preconfigured with standard sections commonly found in software documentation, these can be used to help guide your initial scoping efforts.</p>

    <article><p>Before starting to write content it is best to define the structure of your documentation. How many sections should it have?, what should each section cover?, should some sections have sub-sections. Answering these questions helps to scope the work ahead and define the content that needs to be found or written. While you should decide on the structure of your site at the start be prepared to change it as you gain a deeper understanding of your content. With Presidium it is easy to move artciles between directories.</p>

<p>Presidium comes pre-configured with a standard menu structure that you can use to start scoping your documentation. You can add new sections to Presidum but we have found that the standard section are usually adequate.</p>

<p>First Decide which of the pre-configured sections are not required for your content.</p>

  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Section</th>
      <th>Description of Content</th>
    </tr>

<p>Once you have identified the sections you want to use for your documentation, define the learning objectives for each section. Compile a comprehensive list of learning objectives.</p>

    </div>

    

    <article><p>Think carefully about what it means to use your solution effectively. Try to define what your audience should know, and be able to do, once they have read your documentation. Create a list of these “learning objectives”. Just like the stories used to define software, learning objectives can be written using a standard template.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a [<code class="highlighter-rouge">user</code>] of the [<code class="highlighter-rouge">solution</code>] I [<code class="highlighter-rouge">know a specific piece of information</code>] or can [<code class="highlighter-rouge">perform a specific task</code>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This standard template can be used to create learning objectives like those below. In many cases your existing stories can be re-used as learning objectives with little or no alternation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>As a first time user of Presidium I can easily download, install, and run the latest version.</li>
    <li>As a user of Presidium I know the value of defining learning objectives for developing comprehensive content.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Clearly articulated learning objectives ensure your content stays focused on comprehensive and coherent goals. In Presidium we advise you use learning objectives to help define the title and content of articles. Each learning objective frequently corresponds to one content article.</p>

<h1 id="discussion">Discussion</h1>

<p>Define the knowledge and abilities you expect your target audience to already have before starting to read your documentation. Use these prerequisistes to avoid wasting time explaining things you expect them to already know.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>As a user of Presidium I already know how to use git hub as a version control system.</li>
    <li>As a user of Presdium I know what markdown is, I have used it before, and I know how to lookup details of the markdown syntax I may be unfamilar with.</li>
  </ul>

    <article><p>When starting a documentation initiative it is advisable to review existing content. In most cases it is possible to identify  content that can be re-purposed. Content can be obtained from a variety of sources:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Existing software documentation</li>
  <li>Wikis and message boards</li>
  <li>Design documents</li>
  <li>Work tickets (Epics and Stories, Bugs)</li>
  <li>API specifications</li>
  <li>README files</li>
  <li>Code comments and markup</li>
  <li>Help files</li>
  <li>emails</li>
  <li>Meeting notes</li>
  <li>Project planning materials</li>
</ul>

<p>Compile a list of existing content sources and identify how each item could be decomposed or converted into an article. Identify where these articles fit in your documentation structure.</p>

<h1 id="discussion">Discussion</h1>

<p>Unless someone has already created a comprehensive set of documentation that you can start from you will typically find that some areas have been well documented while others are poorly defined or even missing altogether. Expect to find duplicate and outdated content. Keep a list of the best documentation you have found for any learning objective.</p>
