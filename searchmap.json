If you have access to Github and Github Pages is turned on for your site, you have everything you need. All you need to do it write your content and commit changes, and your content is published automatically. It's really that easy.\n\nMicro-article Based\n\nPresidium is built on sound theoretical strategies for developing learning content and managing knowledge assets. The core of this approach is the development of specific focused micro-articles that explain individual concepts. This splits the problem of content development into two parts:\n\nDefining a site outline based on the concepts that must be documented and how they should be sequenced and presented.\n\nDeveloping articles that each explain each concept, using a standard template to ensure consistency.\n\nMicro-articles break the documentation development and maintenance activities into manageable chunks that can be prioritized based on need. In many cases, it's possible to write and review an article in under 20 minutes.\n\nThis Presidium documentation site not only explains the Presidium software but also includes best practice guidelines for writing your documentation.\n\nEasy Content Maintenance\n\nPresidium is designed to make it easy to write and maintain your documentation. Instead of a monolithic document, Presidium manages a directory structure of micro-articles. The directory structure maps to the sections of your site, while the articles are joined together to build the content of each section. You can create a directory to add new sections and sub-sections. Each section contains a sample article template you can use as a starting point when creating new content. This site explains other best practices for writing articles.\n\nIf you know how to  maintain a codebase in a Github repository, you already know how to maintain Presidium documentation. You can use your team's current Github workflow to manage the approval and publication process and use Github’s features to handle merge conflicts and other issues, just as you do for your source code.\n\nConfigurable Features\n\nPresidium is shipped pre-configured for software documentation. You can easily modify the suggested site structure and behavior. Most teams only need to remove a few sections that are not relevant to their project. Presidium has several configurable features that can be enabled as needed.\n\nServerless\n\nPresidium uses Github for both content management and as a publication server. If you have access to Github and Github pages is turned on for your repository, then you have all you need to start publishing. You don't need to deploy a server or get permission from some dark corner of the enterprise. All you need to do is commit the branch that contains your documentation and Github pages using Jekyll, and Presidium will do the rest.\n\nDespite having no server, there are enough features in the Presidium.js component to meet the needs of most teams. But, if you really need more features, Presidium is open-source and we welcome contributions from the community.\n","updated":"2018-02-27T12:16:15.606Z","roles":[],"author":"virtualtraveler"},{"id":"content/_key-concepts/01-inside-presidium.md","title":"Inside Presidium","slug":"inside-presidium","url":"/key-concepts/#inside-presidium","section":"Key Concepts","category":"","content":"At its core, Presidium is a static website generator built on Jekyll that includes React components for features such as navigation and search.

It's a framework built around a process. And, yes it's opinionated, but it's informed too - who wants to spend time documenting code?

It asks you to think about, structure, author, and publish content based on sensible best practices so you can write effective documentation, rather than producing documentation for documentation's sake.\n\nSupporting Learning Objectives & Efficiency\n\nPresidium recommends creating small 'micro' articles that convey enough information to fulfill a learning objective. Small articles are advantageous because they:\n\nUsually only require a single author\n\nForce the author to focus on effectively describe a single concept\n\nEnable authors to quickly add documentation while also working on a product or service.\n\nUsing this method, creating high quality content is part of the engineering process, not a deferred or protracted task.\n\nCategorization\n\nOften, either only a few people hold all the critical business and technical knowledge or information is spread across documents without organization or cohesion.\n Presidium suggests a way to categorize information that helps the writer compartmentalize and categorize knowledge, leading to more cohesive and logical documentation.\n\nOverview & Key Concepts\n\nAlmost any knowledge base requires an overview to orient the reader in the correct domain. The Overview section should support and lead to a discussion of key concepts that prime the reader to use the rest of the content. These two sections are naturally presented first, and one should follow the another.\n\nPrerequisites & Getting Started\n\nFor software projects, APIs, and similar documentation, most readers will require some initial preparation. This may include installing libraries or binaries and reading information before proceeding.\n\nThe Prerequisites section should support the information in Getting Started. The Getting Started section should be a quick deep-dive than enables a user to get from nowhere to running in minutes.\n\nBest Practices\n\nThe Best Practices section should contain the ideal path to follow to get the most out of your product or service and reduce the potential of encountering problems. They can be a combination of anecdotal knowledge, RFCs, white papers etc.\n\nReference\n\nReferences should enhance or support the information in other sections (for example, imported API documentation, deep-dives beyond the needs of most readers, etc.).\n\nRecipes\n\nRecipes are clear sets of steps that explain how to do something useful or unusual with your product or service.\n\nGlossary\n\nGlossary entries are bite-sized pieces of information that explain a concept, resolve jargon, or list synonyms for a particular term. Because all content in the Glossary can be used for automatic tooltip generation, a good rule of thumb is to make sure a glossary entry can be condensed into a tooltip without being verbose or introducing confusion.\n\nMore\n\nTools, Uses Cases, Updates, and Support are other sections you can use. You can also define your own sections in Presidium.\n","updated":"2018-02-27T12:16:15.642Z","roles":[]},{"id":"content/_key-concepts/04-presidium-worklow.md","title":"Presidium Workflow","slug":"presidium-workflow","url":"/key-concepts/#presidium-workflow","section":"Key Concepts","category":"","content":"Presidium provides workflows templates and tools for building and managing a static technical documentation site.\nAs shown below, all user documentation for a system can be written in Markdown and built into a static site using\nPresidium:\n\nDocumentation Workflow\nHigh-level Workflow and Dependencies\n\nContent Owners\n\nWrite and structure their articles and user documentation in a git repo.\n\nInclude media assets (images, attachments) as required.\n\nInclude reference documentation sources as required.\n\nConfigure and publish their site.\n\nPresidium\n\nProvides:\n\nBase templates, styling, and themes\n\nCommon UI components\n\nBuild workflows via npm:\n\nImport\n\nBuild\n\nServe\n\nPublish\n\nVersion\n\nDependencies\n\nJekyll integration and workflows via npm\n\nReference documentation import:\n\nJavadoc\n\nSwagger\n\nJSDoc\n\nLinking and validation tools\n","updated":"2018-02-27T12:16:15.651Z","roles":[]},{"id":"content/_key-concepts/05-authoring-workflow.md","title":"Authoring Workflow","slug":"authoring-workflow","url":"/key-concepts/#authoring-workflow","section":"Key Concepts","category":"","content":"The following workflow is recommended for authoring content using Presidium.\n\nIdentify the Author\n\nWhether you're creating a single article or an entire section, make sure to include the author tag in the front matter.\n\nWork Locally\n\nPresidium encourages you to write and review documentation on your local machine, rather than making changes directly on Github.
