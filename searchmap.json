If you have access to Github and Github Pages is turned on for your site, then you have everything you need. Write your content, commit changes, and it's published automatically. It really is that easy.\n\nMicro-article based\n\nPresidium is built on sound theoretical strategies for developing learning content and managing knowledge assets. The core of this approach is the development of specific focused micro-articles that explain individual concepts. This splits the problem of content development into two parts.\n\nDefining the site outline in terms of the concepts that must be documented and how they should be sequenced and presented.\n\nDeveloping the articles that each explain one specific concept and follow a standard template for ensure consistency.\n\nMicro-articles break the documentation development and maintenance process into achievable chunks that can be prioritized based on need. We have found it is possible to write and review an article in under 20 minutes.\n\nThis Presidium documentation site explains not only the Presidium software  but also best practices for writing your documentation.\n\nEasy Content Maintenance\n\nPresidium is designed specifically to make it easy to write AND maintain your documentation. Instead of one vast document presidium manages a directory structure of micro-articles. The directory structure maps to the sections of your site, while the articles are joined together to build the content of each section. New sections and sub-sections can be added just by creating a directory. Each section contains a sample article template that can be used as a starting point when creating new content. This site explains other best practices for writing articles.\n\nIf you know how to  maintain a codebase in a github repository, you already know how to maintain Presidium documentation.  Use whatever workflow your team already uses with github to manage the approval and publication process. Use Github’s features to handle merge conflicts and other issues just the same as you do for your source code.\n\nConfigurable Features\n\nPresidium is shipped pre-configured for software documentation. You can easily modify the suggested site structure and behavior.  We have found most teams only need to remove a few sections that are not relevant to their project. Presidium has several configurable features that can be turned on or off as needed.\n\nServerless\n\nPresidium uses github for both content management, and as a publication server. If you have access to github and github pages is turned on for your repository, then you have all you need to start publishing. There is no process of deploying a server or getting permission from some dark corner of the enterprise. All you need to do is commit the branch that contains your documentation and github pages, using Jekyll, will do the rest. Despite having no server we have packed enough features into the Presidium.js component to meet most teams needs. And, if you really need more features, Presidium is open source, we welcome contributions from the community.\n","updated":"2018-02-13T12:38:47.341Z","roles":[]},{"id":"content/_key-concepts/01-inside-presidium.md","title":"Inside Presidium","slug":"inside-presidium","url":"/key-concepts/#inside-presidium","section":"Key Concepts","category":"","content":"Presidium at its core is simply a static website generator built on Jekyll that includes React components for features like navigation and search.

It asks you to think about, structure, author and publish content according to sensible pedagogical best practices.\nIn this way, you will write effective documentation and not produce documentation for documentation's sake.\n\nSupporting Learning Objectives & Efficiency\n\nPresidium recommends creating small 'micro' articles that, in and of themselves, convey enough information to fulfill a learning objective. Small articles are advantageous in that they often only require a single author, force the author to focus on delivering a single concept well, and allow them to add documentation quickly whilst concurrently working on a product or service. In this way, the creation of high quality content is no longer a deferred and protracted task but one interleaved with the engineering process.\n\nCategorization\n\nOften, critical business and technical knowledge is held only by a handful of people, or is spread across documents with little organization and cohesion.\n Presidium suggests a means of categorizing knowledge to assist the writer in compartmentalizing and categorizing their knowledge, for improved cohesion and a logical delivery.\n\nOverview & Key Concepts\n\nAlmost any knowledge base requires an overview as means to ground the reader in the correct domain. This supports and leads to a discussion of key concepts that prime the reader for a cogent use of the rest of the content. These two sections are naturally presented first, and follow one another.\n\nPrerequisites & Getting Started\n\nFor software projects, APIs and similar documentation, most readers will require some preparation before being able to use a product. This may include installing libraries, binaries, or reading material that they should know before proceeding.\n\nThe Prerequisites section supports Getting Started. Getting Started is intended to be a quick deep-dive, such that the user is able to get from nowhere to running in a matter of minutes.\n\nBest Practices\n\nIn this section the objective is to present the best path to follow to get the most out of your product or service and reduce the potential of encountering problems. This can be a combination of anecdotal knowledge, RFCs, white papers etc.\n\nReference\n\nStore content here that enriches or supports anything from other sections: imported API documentation, deep-dives beyond the needs of most readers, etc.\n\nRecipes\n\nPresent a set of clear steps to explain how todo something useful or unusual with your product or service.\n\nGlossary\n\nBite-sized pieces of knowledge that explain a concept, resolve jargon, or lists multiple synonyms for a particular term. Since all content in the Glossary can be used for automatic tooltip generation, a useful yardstick here is to ensure the content can reasonably fulfill the role of a tooltip without verbosity or introducing confusion.\n\nMore\n\nTools, Uses Cases, Updates and Support are a set of other possible sections that might be of use. Presidium allows you the flexibility to define your own sections as well.\n","updated":"2018-02-13T12:38:47.360Z","roles":[]},{"id":"content/_key-concepts/04-presidium-worklow.md","title":"Presidium Workflow","slug":"presidium-workflow","url":"/key-concepts/#presidium-workflow","section":"Key Concepts","category":"","content":"Presidium provides workflows templates and tools for building and managing a static technical documentation site.\nAll user documentation for a system may be written in markdown and built into a static site using \nPresidium as illustrated:\n\nDocumentation Workflow\nHigh-level Workflow and Dependencies\n\nContent Owners\n\nWrite and structure their articles and user documentation in a git repo.\n\nInclude media assets (images, attachments) as required.\n\nInclude reference documentation sources as required.\n\nConfigure and publish their site.\n\nPresidium\n\nProvides:\n\nBase templates, styling and themes\n\nCommon UI components\n\nBuild Workflows via npm:\n\nImport\n\nBuild\n\nServe \n\nPublish\n\nVersion\n\nDependencies\n\nJekyll integration and workflows via npm\n\nReference documentation import:\n\nJavadoc\n\nSwagger\n\nJSDoc\n\nLinting and validation tools\n","updated":"2018-02-13T12:38:47.378Z","roles":[]},{"id":"content/_key-concepts/05-authoring-workflow.md","title":"Authoring Workflow","slug":"authoring-workflow","url":"/key-concepts/#authoring-workflow","section":"Key Concepts","category":"","content":"The suggested workflow for authoring content using Presidium is as follows:\n\nTake Ownership\n\nWhether you're creating a single article or an entire section, make sure you include the author tag in the front matter.\n\nWork Locally\n\nPresidium encourages you to write documentation and review it locally on your machine.
