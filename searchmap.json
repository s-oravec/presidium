Various options are available for controlling navigation behavior.\n\nVersioning \n\nSupport for multiple versions of your documentation. Easily switch from one version to another without losing context.  \n\nMarkup Ingestion \n\nIngestion of markedup source code and API specs allow you to reuse existing documentation investments.\n\nFiltering by Role \n\nDefine user roles and filter site content by a specific selected role\n\nLink Checking \n\nMake sure your links actually go somewhere!\n\nArticle Status Tracking \n\nTrack the status of an article and manage simple authoring workflow. \n\nThemes \n\nEasily select and modify Bootswatch themes to meet your brand requirements. \n\nPresidium was created by SPAN Digital and is licensed under Apache 2.0\n","updated":"2017-06-27T07:57:36.308Z","roles":[]},{"id":"content/_overview/02-benefits.md","title":"Benefits","slug":"benefits","url":"/docs/#benefits","section":"Overview","category":"","content":"Easy Install\n\nPresidium uses Github pages to publish content. If you have access to github and Github pages is turned on for your site, then you have everything you need. Write your content, commit changes, and it's published automatically. It really is that easy. \n\nMicro-article based\n\nPresidium is built on sound theoretical strategies for developing learning content and managing knowledge assets. The core of this approach is the development of specific focused micro-articles that explain individual concepts. This splits the problem of content development into two parts.  \n\nDefining the site outline in terms of the concepts that must be documented and how they should be sequenced and presented. \n\nDeveloping the articles that each explain one specific concept and follow a standard template for ensure consistency. \n\nMicro-articles break the documentation development and maintenance process into achievable chunks that can be prioritized based on need. We have found it is possible to write and review an article in under 20 minutes. \n\nThis Presidium documentation site explains not only the Presidium software  but also best practices for writing your documentation.\n\nEasy Content Maintenance\n\nPresidium is designed specifically to make it easy to write AND maintain your documentation. Instead of one vast document presidium manages a directory structure of micro-articles. The directory structure maps to the sections of your site, while the articles are joined together to build the content of each section. New sections and sub-sections can be added just by creating a directory. Each section contains a sample article template that can be used as a starting point when creating new content. This site explains other best practices for writing articles. \n\nIf you know how to  maintain a codebase in a github repository, you already know how to maintain Presidium documentation.  Use whatever workflow your team already uses with github to manage the approval and publication process. Use Github’s features to handle merge conflicts and other issues just the same as you do for your source code. \n\nConfigurable Features\n\nPresidium is shipped pre-configured for software documentation. You can easily modify the suggested site structure and behavior.  We have found most teams only need to remove a few sections that are not relevant to their project. Presidium has several configurable features that can be turned on or off as needed.\n\nServerless\n\nPresidium uses github for both content management, and as a publication server. If you have access to github and github pages is turned on for your repository, then you have all you need to start publishing. There is no process of deploying a server or getting permission from some dark corner of the enterprise. All you need to do is commit the branch that contains your documentation and github pages, using Jekyll, will do the rest. Despite having no server we have packed enough features into the Presidium.js component to meet most teams needs. And, if you really need more features, Presidium is open source, we welcome contributions from the community. \n","updated":"2017-06-27T07:57:36.322Z","roles":[]},{"id":"content/_key-concepts/key-concepts.md","title":"Documentation Workflow","slug":"documentation-workflow","url":"/docs/key-concepts/#documentation-workflow","section":"Key Concepts","category":"","content":"Presidium provides workflows templates and tools for building and managing a static technical documentation site.\nAll user documentation for a system may be written in markdown and built into a static site using \nPresidium as illustrated:\n\nDocumentation Workflow\nHigh-level Workflow and Dependencies\n\nContent Owners\n\nWrite and structure their articles and user documentation in a git repo\n\nInclude media assets (images, attachments) as required\n\nInclude reference documentation sources as required\n\nConfigure and publish their site\n\nPresidium\n\nProvides:\n\nBase templates, styling and themes\n\nCommon UI components\n\nBuild Workflows via npm:\n\nImport\n\nBuild\n\nServe \n\nPublish\n\nVersion\n\nDependencies\n\nJekyll integration and workflows via npm\n\nReference documentation import:\n\nJavadoc\n\nSwagger (under development)\n\nJSDoc (under development)\n\nLinting and validation tools\n","updated":"2017-06-27T07:57:36.345Z","roles":[]},{"id":"content/_prerequisites/01-required-software.md","title":"Required Software","slug":"required-software","url":"/docs/prerequisites/#required-software","section":"Prerequisites","category":"","content":"The following tools are required to build and run your site locally:\n\nnpm v3.10+\n\nruby v2.1+\n\nbundler v1.14.3+\n\nPresidium uses:\n\nnpm to build, run and publish your site\n\nruby to run Jekyll \n\nbundler to manage Jekyll dependencies\n\nAll required dependencies are managed via npm scripts and are local to each site you create, so there is \nno need to install and configure Jekyll.\n","updated":"2017-06-27T07:57:36.355Z","roles":[]},{"id":"content/_prerequisites/02-environment-setup/01-osx.md","title":"OSX","slug":"osx","url":"/docs/prerequisites/local-environment-setup/#osx","section":"Prerequisites","category":"Local Environment Setup","content":"NPM\n\nInstall using the node package or nvm\n\nnode v6.10 (LTS)\n\nnpm v3.10\n\nRuby\n\nRequires ruby >= 2.1 available using homebrew:\n\n\n\nBundler\n\n\n","updated":"2017-06-27T07:57:36.358Z","roles":[]},{"id":"content/_prerequisites/02-environment-setup/02-debian.md","title":"Debian","slug":"debian","url":"/docs/prerequisites/local-environment-setup/#debian","section":"Prerequisites","category":"Local Environment Setup","content":"The following script may be used to provision a Debian based environment:\n\n\n","updated":"2017-06-27T07:57:36.359Z","roles":[]},{"id":"content/_getting-started/getting-started.md","title":"Setting up your First Site","slug":"setting-up-your-first-site","url":"/docs/getting-started/#setting-up-your-first-site","section":"Getting Started","category":"","content":"Create a New Site\n\nDownload and extract the sample template\n\nRun the following from your project directory to install required dependencies:\n\n\n\nIf you get an error, check that you have the following prerequisites installed on your environment:\n\nnpm v3.10+\n\nruby v2.1+\n\nbundler v1.14.3+\n\nRun Presidium\n\nTo start your site, run the following from your project folder:\n\n\n\nThis will build your site to dist/site and serve it locally on: http&#x3A;//localhost:4000/\n\nEdit Content\n\nOnce your site is up and running, you can start making changes to the following files and folders:\n\ncontent/ Content folder for all your articles\n\nmedia/ Media folder for static assets such as images, attachments or css\n\n\\_config.yml Site configuration properties\n\nUpdates to content, media or css can be made without having to restart the local server. \nStructural or changes to configuration currently require a server restart.\n\nPublish your Site\n\nThe simplest way to publish a github repository is to use Github Pages, but you can also host the generated site on any Web server.\n\nTo Github Pages\n\nTo publish using Github Pages, commit and push your site to a Github repository and run the following:\n\n\n\nThis will push your generated site to a gh-pages branch in your repository.
